# Chaos Mod for SCP: Secret Laboratory

## Description
Chaos Mod is a plugin for SCP: Secret Laboratory inspired by GTA SA/V Chaos Mod. Every minute it adds a new modifier to the game, and removes previous one making it more fun for people looking for something new.

## List of modifiers
I advise to not check the list, and checkout the modifiers in the game instead.
